//improvemnt 1: 
query templates & smart suggestions to UI as user types: {
  "query_templates": {
    "shipment_analytics": [
      "Show me shipment status distribution for last month",
      "Find average delivery time by city",
      "List top 10 customers by shipment volume"
    ],
    "financial_reports": [
      "Show total COD collection by supplier",
      "Find revenue by payment type",
      "List pending payments over 30 days"
    ]
  }
}


//improvemnt 2: 
//Data visualization: 
// Add chart components
import { BarChart, LineChart, PieChart } from 'recharts'

const ResultsVisualization = ({ data, queryType }) => {
  // Auto-detect chart type based on data structure
  // Render appropriate visualization
}



Architecture overview and flow
Core path: POST /api/v2/query → intelligent_sql_generator.generate_accurate_sql → stages:
Table retrieval via schema_index (BM25 + centrality) with keyword fallback.
Context build: focused schema + relationship and code-mapping hints; optional examples RAG.
Plan-then-generate: llm_handler.generate_sql (plan JSON → validated/auto-repaired → SQL).
Validation loop: schema-aware validation, scoping enforcement, join/column checks, optional EXPLAIN feedback loop.
Execute with guardrails, optional result explanation.
Schema: rich JSON in graph/schema_graph.json with tables, columns, examples, code mappings, and relationships including explicit to_column where needed; graph built in SchemaGraph and retrieval in SchemaIndex.
LLM usage: configurable providers, prompts include strict rules and few-shots; circuit-breaker wrapped; plan validator enforces structure/repairs joins/columns; SQL generator adheres to plan.
Validation: QueryValidator ensures scoping, safety rules, max tables, operation whitelist, join correctness, column existence hints; iterative refinement on failures.
Logging/metrics: event/audit logs in JSONL with rotation; basic API metrics middleware.



//PROMPT TO CHECK AND VALIDATE 
You are an expert AI-Assistant specialized in Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems, database schema understanding, and LLM-based accuracy improvement. I will provide you with my NL2SQL codebase. Your task is to carefully review the code, analyze the architecture, and identify strengths, weaknesses, and bottlenecks that may reduce accuracy.
While reviewing, focus on:
Query translation accuracy (handling of joins, nested queries, ambiguous natural language).
Schema representation (graph-based, embeddings, linking strategies).
LLM usage (prompting, fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, error handling).
Evaluation & metrics (exact match accuracy, execution accuracy, error categories).
Code quality & modularity (maintainability, scalability, extensibility).
After reviewing, suggest specific, practical improvements with reasoning, examples, and possible implementation strategies. Highlight trade-offs (accuracy vs. latency vs. complexity) and recommend best practices to improve accuracy.
Finally, summarize the top 3 improvements I should prioritize for maximum accuracy gain.
